# Text_to_SQL_using_GPT3

The combination of GPT-3 and Python can be used to convert natural language queries into SQL code, allowing users to easily access and manipulate data in a database. This can be accomplished by using the Python API provided by OpenAI, which allows developers to easily integrate GPT-3 into their Python-based projects.

To use GPT-3 for text-to-SQL conversion, developers would first need to provide the model with a prompt that includes both a natural language query and the SQL code needed to execute the query. For example, a prompt could be "What is the average salary for employees in the Sales department?" which includes both the natural language query and the SQL code needed to execute the query.

In response, GPT-3 would generate a SQL query that retrieves the relevant information from the database, such as:

SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'

The Python API provided by OpenAI would then allow developers to easily integrate this generated SQL query into their Python-based application, allowing users to easily access and manipulate data in the database.

Overall, the combination of GPT-3 and Python provides a powerful and flexible solution for text-to-SQL conversion, allowing users to easily convert natural language queries into SQL code, and to easily access and manipulate data in a database.
